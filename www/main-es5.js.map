No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure\\n    itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter\\n    consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of\\n    itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some\\n    great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain\\n    some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no\\n    annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\\n</p>\\n'\n                },\n                {\n                    'title'  : 'How do I change my username?',\n                    'content': '<p><b>The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s</b></p>\\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna\\n    aliqua.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure\\n    itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter\\n    consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of\\n    itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some\\n    great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain\\n    some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no\\n    annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\\n</p>\\n'\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ];\n}\n","export class MailFakeDb\n{\n    public static mails = [\n        {\n            'id'            : '15459251a6d6b397565',\n            'from'          : {\n                'name'  : 'Alice Freeman',\n                'avatar': 'assets/images/avatars/alice.jpg',\n                'email' : 'alicefreeman@creapond.com'\n            },\n            'to'            : [\n                {\n                    'name' : 'me',\n                    'email': 'johndoe@creapond.com'\n                }\n            ],\n            'subject'       : 'Commits that need to be pushed lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.',\n            'message'       : '<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
